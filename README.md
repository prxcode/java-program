# Java Programming Practice
This repository includes topic-wise Java code and mini projects like [Juno-IDE: Code editor for running java code](https://github.com/prxcode/juno-ide/) I built while learning Java. However, *it's still in progress so it gets updated daily*!

## Structure
### 1. Basic Intro topic in Java Programming 
- Print Hello world in Java

- Operators
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- All about Patterns
- Space & Time Complexity
- Arrays
- 2D Arrays
- String
- StringBuilder
- Bit Manipulation
- Sorting in Java
- Recursion

### 2. Java OOPs
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors & this keyword
- Inheritance (IS-A relationship)
- Polymorphism (compile-time & runtime)
- Encapsulation & Access Modifiers
- Abstraction using interfaces & abstract classes
- Method Overloading & Overriding
- super and final keywords

- Linked Lists
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Graphs
- Heaps / Priority Queues
- Tries
- Bit Manipulation
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
- Binary Search & Search Space

### 5. Java Projects
- Simple Game in Java
- Simple Compiler in Java

  
## Installation & Basic Setup
Simple Breakdown to compare Java and C working.


C file is directly compiled to machine code by any compiler like gcc, and this machine code runs on that specific OS where it got compiled 
```bash
.c file ──► [Compiler] ──► .exe (native code) ──► Runs directly on OS
```

Java file is compiled as bytecode by Java Compiler, this bytecode can run on any platform but once it gets converted to machine code its no more platform independent

```
.java file ──► [javac] ──► .class (bytecode)
```
and this bytecode is converted to machine code by JVM which runs on platform 
```
.class ──► [JVM] ──► interpreted or JIT compiled ──► runs on platform
```
